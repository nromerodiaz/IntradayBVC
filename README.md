In the last twenty years securitiesâ€™ trading has become increasingly automated and most exchanges have adopted electronic markets. The trading of the most liquid securities at the intraday generates substantial amount of information that is important for academic and practitioners. The historical intraday information provides insights with different applications such as the optimization of trading strategies, risk management, research on market microstructure and behavioral finance. However, the challenge is to process the data efficiently and accurately. This project provides a first step towards this goal.
We use Python and Jupyter notebooks to illustrate how to use Trade and Quote Data provided by the exchanges or some other data provider to build historical indicators of market quality (trading activity, volatility, liquidity, price impact).

The figure presents a schematic view of the tools that are available.

To start working with the code and the sample data go to the [Example folder](https://github.com/nromerodiaz/SciPy2019/tree/master/Example) and follow the instructions. 

Although TAQ data provides already some insights into high frequency finance our goal is to eventually have the opportunity to reconstruct the Limit Order Book for the local market and hopefully provide this data to practitioner and the scientific community to foster the development of capital markets in Colombia.   
Do not hesitate to contact us for any questions regarding the tools and examples.
